I have always sought out to be the best that I can be academically. As I grew up, I also faced different obstacles that hindered my mindset into reaching the goals that I wanted to achieve. This year, I'm ready to take on new responsibilities to see how far I can go professionally and as an individual.

## Joining Year Up! ðŸ¦‹

**What excites me about my Year Up Program Management journey:**
*I believe that the Year Up program classes have taught me more about the business field and I am reminded of why I still find technology fascinating and rewarding.*
- I get to congratulate and celebrate my peers achievements along the way and see them be excited about their future.
- I am excited for the possibilities ahead and show myself what skills I am capable of.
- New friendships and connections in the workspace.
- I get to build my professional network with connecting to professionals in the corporate space.

**An accomplishment during my Year Up journey that I am most proud of:**
There are many things I could say that I'm proud of during the program. From adjusting to a morning schedule to learning to manage my time and balance between work and school. That's not to say it's easy! Though, I am most proud of perservering. I am doing the work to invest in my future and I am learning new things along the way that I look forward to implementing in internship or any workplace.
